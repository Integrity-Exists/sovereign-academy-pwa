<h1>What to Do If You're Arrested</h1>
<p>Being arrested can be a frightening experience, but knowing your rights and how to
respond can make a significant difference. Here's what you should do:</p>
<h2>1. Remain Calm and Composed</h2>
<p>Stay calm and do not resist arrest, even if you believe it's unjust. Resisting can lead to
additional charges and potential harm.</p>
<h2>2. Exercise Your Right to Remain Silent</h2>
<p>You have the right to remain silent. Clearly state, "I am exercising my right to remain
silent." Do not provide explanations or excuses.</p>
<h2>3. Request an Attorney Immediately</h2>
<p>Ask for a lawyer as soon as possible. Say, "I want to speak to a lawyer." The police must
stop questioning you until your attorney is present.</p>
<h2>4. Do Not Consent to Searches</h2>
<p>Politely refuse any searches of your person, vehicle, or property. Say, "I do not consent to
a search."</p>
<h2>5. Know Your Rights</h2>
<ul>
<li>You have the right to a local phone call. If you call a lawyer, the police cannot listen.</li>
<li>You have the right to know the charges against you.</li>
<li>You have the right to a fair trial.</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Document the Encounter</h2>
<p>As soon as possible, write down everything you remember, including officers' badge
numbers, patrol car numbers, and any other relevant details.</p>
<h2>7. Do Not Discuss Your Case</h2>
<p>Avoid discussing your case with anyone other than your attorney. This includes phone calls
from jail, as they may be recorded.</p>
<h2>8. Follow Legal Advice</h2>
<p>Trust your attorney's guidance throughout the legal process. They are there to protect your
rights and advocate on your behalf.</p>

    <h1>Know Your Rights During Traffic Stops</h1>

    <p><strong>🚨 If You’re Pulled Over:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Stay calm. Turn off the engine. Keep hands visible on the wheel.</li>
      <li>Roll down your window slightly and ask:<br />
      <em>“Am I being detained, or am I free to go?”</em></li>
      <li>Do NOT consent to searches. Say:<br />
      <em>“I do not consent to any searches.”</em></li>
      <li>You can record — and in most states, it's fully legal. Say:<br />
      <em>“For my safety and yours, I am recording this interaction.”</em></li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>🦴 K9 Search Tip:</strong> Officers CANNOT delay a stop just to bring in a drug dog. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled this in <em>Rodriguez v. United States</em>, 575 U.S. 348 (2015).</p>

    <p><strong>✋ You Do NOT Have to:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Let them search your vehicle unless they have a warrant or probable cause</li>
      <li>Answer questions like “Where are you going?”</li>
      <li>Step out of the car unless ordered</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>🗣️ If You Are Detained or Arrested:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>“I’m invoking my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. I want a lawyer.”</blockquote>

    <p><strong>⚖️ Tip from Sage:</strong> You do NOT have to be rude. Just be firm. Let the facts, not emotion, drive your case. Ask Sage inside the app for more support if you’re facing charges.</p>
